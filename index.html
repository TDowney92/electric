						<h3> ELECTRICITY</h3>
						<p>Most households and small businesses pay time-of-use electricity prices that appear on the “Electricity” line of the bill. As the regulator, the OEB sets electricity prices twice a year: May 1 and November 1. Prices are based on the estimated cost
							to supply electricity in the province for the next six months.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6" id="deliv">
						<h3>DELIVERY</h3>
						<p>This is made up of two separate costs. Both are approved by the OEB.</p>
						<h5>1. TRANSMISSION</h5>
						<p>Power flows from Ontario power plants and other sources, through transmission lines, to your local utility. Every home in Ontario pays the same rate to cover these costs.</p>
						<h5>2. DISTRIBUTION</h5>
						<p>A distribution company (also called “distributor” or “local utility”) delivers electricity to homes and businesses through a network of power lines within the communities it serves.</p>
					</div>
					<!-- end of col-6 -->
					<div class="col-md-6" id="reg">
						<h3>REGULATORY</h3>
						<p>This is made up of the costs to administer the wholesale electricity system and maintain the reliability of the provincial grid. It also includes costs for funding Ministry of Energy conservation, renewable and low-income energy programs.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6" id="glob">
						<h3>GLOBAL ADJUSTMENT AND ENERGY CONTRACTS</h3>
						<p>If you buy electricity from your utility, the electricity price already includes your share of the “Global Adjustment.” <strong>If
							you sign a contract with an energy retailer, you pay the
								agreed-upon contract price (not time-of-use or tiered
								prices set by the OEB). You will also need to pay your
								share of the Global Adjustment.</strong> It will appear as a new, separate line on your utility bill.</p>

						<h2> TIME-OF-USE ELECTRICITY PRICES </h2>
						<p> Households and small businesses in Ontario pay time-of-use prices for electricity that change according to the TIME OF DAY and DAY OF THE WEEK. The peak periods also change by SEASON. Your smart meter tells your utility exactly how much power you
							use and when you use it. With this information, your utility charges you for the amount of power you use at off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak times.</p>
						<br>
						<h4>REASOMS FOR DIFFRENT PRICES </h4>
						<br>
						<p><strong>When Demand is Low</strong>and fewer people are using power, lower-cost electricity is available from sources like nuclear and large hydroelectric systems.</p>
						<p><strong>When Demand Rises</strong>during the day, the province’s supply of lower-cost electricity is used up, and more expensive sources need to be used.</p>

						<h3>WEEKDAYS</h3>
						<h3>WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS </h3>
						<img src="img/graph.svg" alt="hydro graph" />
						<h5>Summer</h5>
						<p>Electricity use peaks during the hottest part of the afternoon, when air conditioners are running on high.</p>
						<h5>Winter</h5>
						<p>Less daylight means electricity use peaks twice: once in the morning when people wake up and turn on their lights and appliances, and again when people get home from work.</p>
						<div class="col-sm-4" id="periods">
